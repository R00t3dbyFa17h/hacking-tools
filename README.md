# Offensive Security Tooling Archive

### 🛡️ Mission Statement
This repository serves as a centralized archive for custom-developed offensive security tooling, developed by **R00t3dbyFa17h**. The objective of this collection is to bridge the gap between manual penetration testing methodologies and automated efficiency.

Every tool in this repository is engineered to address specific friction points in the **Cyber Kill Chain**, specifically focusing on:

* **Attack Surface Management (ASM):** Rapid identification of external assets.
* **Reconnaissance Automation:** Reducing the "Time-to-Insight" during red team engagements.
* **Data Aggregation:** Synthesizing data from disparate sources (DNS, HTTP, SSL) into actionable intelligence.

This is a living documentation of the journey from theoretical exploit understanding to practical, programmatic implementation.

### 📂 Current Toolset

| Tool Name | Language | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **ZeroRecon** | Python 3 | A multi-stage reconnaissance pipeline integrating passive and active enumeration heuristics. |
