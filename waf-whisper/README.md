## 📖 The Foundation
> *"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."*
> — **Matthew 10:16**

**WAF Whisper** is not just a scanner; it is an intelligent evasion framework.

Modern Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, and Akamai utilize heuristic analysis and behavior profiling. Traditional tools that simply "fuzz" endpoints get IP-banned immediately. 

**WAF Whisper** was engineered to defeat these defenses using the **Guardrail-Ghost Engine**—adapting to the target's "patience" and mathematically fragmenting attacks to remain invisible.

---

## 🧠 The Guardrail-Ghost Architecture

The engine operates on a decision loop that prioritizes stealth over speed. Instead of blindly firing payloads, it follows this strict logic flow:

1.  **Target Identification:** Checks if the target is live.
2.  **Passive Fingerprinting:** Identifies WAF headers without attacking.
3.  **Ghost Mode Decision:** If a WAF is found, it engages User-Agent rotation and jitter.
4.  **Rate Limit Probing:** Tests the WAF's patience to find the maximum safe speed.
5.  **Payload Fragmentation:** Splits attacks into chunks smaller than the WAF's inspection limit.
6.  **Whisper Attack:** Reassembles the payload on the server side to bypass detection.

## 📜 Version History & Changelog

This tool has evolved from a simple fuzzer to a stateful evasion engine.

| Version | Codename | Key Capabilities Added |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v5.0** | **Guardrail-Ghost** | Current Release. Added MPL Fragmentation, Binary Search Rate Limiting, and Phase 8 Blind Verification. |
| **v4.2** | **Low-and-Slow** | Introduced `--delay` algorithm to defeat heuristic rate monitoring. |
| **v3.0** | **Ghost Mode** | Added Random User-Agent Rotation and Passive WAF Fingerprinting (Cloudflare/AWS detection). |
| **v2.1** | **Proxy Link** | Added `-p` flag for integration with BurpSuite and OWASP ZAP. |
| **v1.0** | **Whisper** | Initial Release. Basic Payload Mutation (URL Encoding/Double URL). |

## 🛡️ Key Features

### 👻 Phase 0: Ghost Mode (Client Emulation)
* **Signature Spoofing:** Injects TLS-consistent headers to indistinguishably mimic legitimate browser traffic.
* **Randomized UA Rotation:** Automatically cycles User-Agents to prevent fingerprinting during prolonged scans.

### ⏱️ Phase 4: Adaptive Rate Limit Profiling
* **Dynamic Throttling:** The tool doesn't guess the speed limit; it finds it.
* **Low-and-Slow:** Uses the `--delay` algorithm to introduce randomized "human" latency between requests.

### 🧩 Phase 6: MPL Discovery & Fragmentation
* **Max Payload Length (MPL):** Uses a binary search algorithm to find the exact byte limit the WAF inspects.
* **Fragmentation Attack:** Automatically splits complex payloads into chunks smaller than the MPL, reassembling them on the server side.

### 🗣️ Phase 7: Semantic Polyglots
* **Signature Inversion:** Bypasses keyword filters (e.g., `cat /etc/passwd`) using shell expansion and IFS evasion specific to Linux backends.

## ⚙️ Installation

**1. Clone the Repository**

`git clone [https://github.com/R00t3dbyFa17h/WAF-Whisper.git](https://github.com/R00t3dbyFa17h/WAF-Whisper.git)
cd WAF-Whisper`

2. Install Dependencies


`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

🚀 Usage
1. Ghost Mode Scan (Recommended)

Engage Guardrail-Ghost mode with randomized User-Agents to avoid detection.


`python3 waf_whisper.py -u [https://target.com](https://target.com) --ghost`

2. Low-and-Slow Evasion

Manually override the delay (in seconds) to bypass strict rate-limiting sensors.


`python3 waf_whisper.py -u [https://target.com](https://target.com) --delay 5`

3. Proxied Scan (BurpSuite/Zap)

Route traffic through a local proxy for deeper analysis.


`python3 waf_whisper.py -u [https://target.com](https://target.com) -p [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) -v`

4. Full Help Menu
Plaintext

`usage: waf_whisper.py [-h] -u URL [-v] [-p PROXY] [--delay DELAY] [--ghost]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --url             Target URL (e.g., [https://example.com](https://example.com))
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  -p, --proxy           Proxy URL (e.g., [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080))
  --delay DELAY         Manual override for Low-and-Slow delay (seconds)
  --ghost               Enable Guardrail-Ghost Mode (Randomized UA Rotation)`
