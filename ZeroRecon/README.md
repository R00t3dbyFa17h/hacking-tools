## 📖 Overview
**ZeroRecon** is not just a wrapper; it is a unified reconnaissance framework designed to reduce "Time-to-Insight" for red teamers and bug bounty hunters. 

It automates the entire discovery lifecycle—from **subdomain discovery** to **vulnerability scanning**—in a single execution flow. Unlike fragmented scripts, ZeroRecon uses a **"Double-Probe"** protocol to ensure no asset is left behind.

> **Slogan:** 🛑 → Zero in on targets with accuracy.

---

## ⚙️ The Architecture
ZeroRecon orchestrates a 7-layer pipeline:

1.  **Paranoid Discovery:** Aggregates data from `Subfinder`, `Assetfinder`, `Findomain`, `Chaos`, and `Crt.sh`.
2.  **Deep Archival Mining:** Uses `Gau` to scrape the Wayback Machine for forgotten subdomains and API endpoints.
3.  **Double-Probe Verification:** Runs `Httpx` AND `Httprobe` simultaneously to catch zombie hosts that other scanners miss.
4.  **Parameter Crawling:** Uses `Katana` to spider live hosts and extract hidden parameters (`?id=`) for IDOR hunting.
5.  **Auto-Nuke:** Automatically launches `Nuclei` templates against live assets to find critical vulnerabilities (CVEs, Exposed Panels).

## 🚀 Installation
Stop wasting time installing tools manually. ZeroRecon comes with a bootstrap script that provisions the entire environment.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/R00t3dbyFa17h/hacking-tools.git](https://github.com/R00t3dbyFa17h/hacking-tools.git)

# 2. Navigate to the folder
cd hacking-tools

# 3. Run the Auto-Installer (Root required)
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
```
💻 Usage
1. The "Quick Map" (Standard Recon)

Maps the attack surface. Good for a quick overview.


`python3 ZeroRecon.py -t Target.com`

2. The "Paranoid" Scan (Recommended)

Enables all 7 layers of discovery, including Amass and DNS brute forcing (if configured). Use this for bug bounties.


`python3 ZeroRecon.py -t Target.com --paranoid`

3. The "Bug Hunter" (Full Kill Chain)

This maps the network, crawls for parameters (IDORs), and scans for CVEs automatically.


`python3 ZeroRecon.py -t Target.com --paranoid --crawl --nuclei`

4. The "API & Ghost" Hunt

Specifically targets API endpoints (Swagger/GraphQL) and historical endpoints that no longer exist on the main site.


`python3 ZeroRecon.py -t Target.com --api --history`

5. Remote Alerts (Discord)

Run the script on a VPS and get a ping on your phone when it's done.


`python3 ZeroRecon.py -t Target.com --paranoid --webhook "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"`
